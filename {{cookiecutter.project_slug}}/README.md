{{cookiecutter.description}}

This is a plugin for [Python LSP Server](https://github.com/python-lsp/python-lsp-server).

## Installation

To use this plugin, you need to install this plugin in the same virtualenv as python-lsp-server itself.

``` bash
pip install {{ cookiecutter.project_slug }}
```

Then run `python-lsp-server` as usual, the plugin will be auto-discovered by
`python-lsp-server` if you've installed it to the right environment. Refer to
`python-lsp-server` and your IDE/text editor documentation on how to setup
`python-lsp-server`.

## Configuration

## Features

This plugin adds the following features to `pylsp`:

## Developing

Install development dependencies with (you might want to create a virtualenv first):

``` bash
git clone {{cookiecutter.repository_url}} {{cookiecutter.project_slug}}
cd {{cookiecutter.project_slug}}
pip install -e '.[dev]'
```

### Enabling logging

To enable logging in pylsp:

    pylsp -v --log-file /tmp/pylsp.log

### Enabling tcp mode

Normally, editors communicate with language servers through standard
input/output. Optionally, you can run pylsp in tcp mode if you want to be able
to use the standard input/output, for example so you can use IPython or pudb,
using the --tcp flag:

    pylsp -v --log-file /tmp/pylsp.log --tcp --port 7090

Consult your lsp client documentation on how to connect to tcp-mode language
server, but if it doesn't support connecting to a language server via TCP, then
usually can configure `netcat`/`nc` to be your "language server" that will
proxy requests to a tcp-mode language server:

    nc localhost 7090

TODO: document how to connect to pylsp via pylsp from LSP clients.

## Publishing

If this is your first time publishing to PyPI, follow the instruction at [Twine
docs](https://packaging.python.org/guides/distributing-packages-using-setuptools/#create-an-account)
to create an PyPI account and setup Twine.

1. Update version number in `setup.cfg`.

2. Build a package using setuptools:

``` bash
python -m build
twine check dist/*
```

3. Tag the release:

```
git tag --sign 0.1.3
git push origin 0.1.3
```

4. Then upload using Twine:

```
twine upload --sign dist/*
```

Alternatively, you may want to upload to Test PyPI first before going live:

```
twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*
```
